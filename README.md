#BUILT WITH#
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JS

#FEATURES#
* User input parsing object, accumulates user input (digits selected and mathematical operators) to construct a mathematical expression with infix notation
* Infix expression is converted to postfix notation, to allow for handling operator precedence (Implemented the Shunting yard algorithm to do this)
* Calculator object receives a postfix expression as input and processes it to return the result of the expression.
* Comma insertion on inputs and outputs to improve readability
* Responsive scaling of input and output, when the content overflows the calculator display

#NEW LEARNING#
* Reverse Polish Notation (a.k.a postfix)
* Shunting yard algorithm, for infix to postfix conversion
